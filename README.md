<h1>Story Sourcer</h2>
</div>

A crowd sourced bank of stories that can be used by language teachers who utilize the Comprehensible Input teaching method. Its goal is to allow teachers to share adapted stories with one another, saving them precious class planning time.

## Motivation

Prior to my career as a developer, I worked as a language teacher using a method called Comprehensible Input (CI). CI is based around stories and storytelling. Teachers use all sorts of stories from folktales to ones they made up. The stories are adapted into language that the student's can understand, requiring the teacher to translate them into simpler vocabulary.

As a teacher, this was something I spent a ton of time doing. With Story Sourcer, teachers can share their adapted stories with one another. The stories can then be filtered by various criteria such as the target age of students, the story's source, or the length of the story to ensure they can find stories that meet their student's needs.
